**How to use this app:**
1. Select a city and business category (and optionally a specific business name)
2. Review the map showing all matching businesses
3. Select a specific business with multiple locations from the dropdown
4. Analyze sentiment for a specific location

**Understanding sentiment scores:**
- Scores range from -1.0 (very negative) to 1.0 (very positive)
- A score of 0 indicates neutral sentiment
- Scores are calculated using natural language processing on customer reviews

**What the colors mean:**
- Green: Positive sentiment (> 0)
- Red: Negative sentiment (< 0)
- Gray: Neutral sentiment (= 0)
